    /**************
     * Strings, Numbers and Booleans (or any primitive types including NULL and undefined): copy by value
     * Array and Object: copy by reference
     **************/

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let players_copy1 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players_copy2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players_copy3 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players_copy1[0] = 'Bob';
    players_copy2[0] = 'Alex';
    players_copy3[0] = 'Mary';
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players_copy1);
    console.log(players_copy2);
    console.log(players_copy3);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let person_copy1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 82});
    console.log(person);
    console.log(person_copy1);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const original_obj = {
      name: 'original',
      lvl: {
        lvl1: 'lvl1',
        lvl2: 2
      }
    };

    let obj_cp1 = Object.assign({}, original_obj);
    obj_cp1.lvl.lvl3 = 3;

    console.log(obj_cp1);
    console.log(original_obj);

    // deep clone using JSON: unknown performance (make the obj into a string then back to an obj)

    const original_obj2 = {
      name: 'original2',
      lvl: {
        lvl1: 'lvl1',
        lvl2: 2
      }
    };

    let obj_cp2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original_obj2));
    obj_cp2.lvl.lvl3 = '3';

    console.log(obj_cp2);
    console.log(original_obj2);
